# AI-Cheating-Detection 🎓

An AI-powered cheating behavior detection system using **YOLOv11**, designed for exam monitoring with real-time alerts and privacy-focused posture analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional exam monitoring relies heavily on human proctors, who are subject to fatigue, bias, and limited coverage. This project proposes a smarter, AI-based alternative that uses computer vision to detect cheating behavior in real time based on body pose and motion—without using facial recognition to preserve privacy.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 YOLOv11-based posture classification (Cheating vs Normal)
- 📹 Live webcam/CCTV input
- 🛎️ Real-time alerts via a clean web dashboard
- 📼 Session recording and playback
- 🔐 Local-only processing — no cloud dependency
- 🧑‍🏫 Supervisor-friendly UI: camera control, alert logs, and evidence snapshots

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **YOLOv11** – Object detection and pose classification
- **Flask** – Python backend framework
- **Firebase** – User authentication and real-time database
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – Frontend interface
- **Roboflow** – Dataset annotation and model versioning
